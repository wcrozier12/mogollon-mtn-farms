        We consistently have early girls, big boys, and better boy tomatoes.
        These strains are large, round and sweet. Perfect for a sandwich, sauce,

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
